Highlights
------------------------------------

I am glad that people comes up with various solutions with trade-off so that we all learn from each others

1) Vu has an easy-to-understand solution with O(N) time and O(1): https://github.com/P2PLearning/DSA/pull/28/files

2) Duy has a very short solution using build-in library  with O(logN) time and O(N) space): https://github.com/P2PLearning/DSA/pull/30

3) Trang and Hong has solutions close to my sample one (with O(logN) time and O(N) space): https://repl.it/@HienTo/generateRandomValue-Solution#Main.java

Tips
------------------------------------
See how python implements `random.choices`. In practice, time is more important here; hence, the library uses binary search to speed things up.
