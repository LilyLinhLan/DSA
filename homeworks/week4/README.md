I am glad that people comes up with various solutions with trade-off so that we all learn from each others

1) Easy to understand solution with O(N) time and O(1) space from Vu Nguyen: https://github.com/P2PLearning/DSA/pull/28/files

2) Very short solution using build-in library from Duy Nguyen: https://github.com/P2PLearning/DSA/pull/30

3) Sample solution with O(logN) time and O(N) space: https://repl.it/@HienTo/generateRandomValue-Solution#Main.java
